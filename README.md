# Django_blog

I have created a blog site using Django framework. I have learned basics of Django with Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller course, but I didn't walk through it step by step. 
I always make things by myself without any hints. 
To make course little harder (not repeating course scheme) I decided to create fornt-end using one of bootstrap template. 

The site is deployed on AWS on this URL adress:
